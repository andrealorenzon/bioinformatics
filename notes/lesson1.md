## Exploring the emerging role of the transposable elements in the animal nervous system

Human genome sequencing. Half of it is junk. Coding part is 3% of the genome (that is 30-40K genes). We know the grammar only of that.

Moreover, there are regulatory regions in the genome, with another grammar, more flexible, that decide where and when the gene is transcribed. There are also nonconding regions, whose mRNA is not translated into a protein. Finally, there are repeated regions of the genome.

These can be mixed, and this does not help. 

**controllare se funziona Ulysses**

In organisms, with increasing complexity, at a certain point the number of coding regions is capped (around $10^8$), while non coding regions increases linearly up to $10^9$ .

**regulatory regions** clusters of **TFBS**: promoters, enhancers (the latter can also be transcribed).

**non coding RNAs**: they are transcribed but not translated. They can work both in cis or trans. (cis: work near the region where it is in the genome. Trans: act on far dna  (another chromosome, gene,..)). They are involved in transcriptional and translational regulation, epigenetics, etc.. Types: miRNA, snoRNA, tRNA, or longer lncRNA. 

**repeats**: low complexity sequences, repeated thousands/million times or transposons, that have a complex sequence and can "move" to new genomic locations.

more on trasposons: or transposable elements (TEs) : they can move from a location in the gene to another, They can copy-paste or cut-paste.  This works with a mRNA intermediate. They are present in all organisms (1-65% of all genes), higher in plants (70% in Zea mays). 50% in humans. 

there are different families of transposons.

* DNA Transposons: cut-and-paste method. Authonomous elements. they codify for transposase. also have Direct Repeat (DR) and Inverted Repeat (ITR) elements at the ends.
* LTR retrotransposons: Long Terminal Repeats (LTR). Derived from retroviruses. Copy-and-paste. Codify for virus-like-domain proteins. Have LTR at the ends. TSD (target site duplication) at the integration sites. Before development, the embryo start to transcribe them, to make a priming of the immune system. 
* non-LTR retrotransposons: similar, but without LTR. codes for 1 or 2 complete proteins (with endonuclease and reverse transcriptase domains). Presents TSD at the integration sites.
* non-authonomous retrotrasposones: do not codify for any protein ( ex. SINE and SVA). Transcribed but not translated. Presents TSD. Use protein machinery of authonomous elements.

A specie can be "invaded" by one or more of the specific classes of RT. In humans, 75% are non-LTR.  We'll just call them TEs (Transposable Elements). They are important because they ahve **effects**. They might move around the genome sequences, because they contain **portable regulatory elements** to help make the transcription start, in case they finish in a non-transcribed region.  Every time they moves, something can happen: 

* introduction of new information (new enhancer, new repressors..)
* new splice sites
* new promoters or transcription start sites
* insertional mutagenesis (insertion in exon, enhancer, repressor)

Entire genes are built and derived by TEs, or by the fusion of a TE and a non-TE elements: this process is called **exaptation**: when a gene acquires a fuction for what it was not originally designed.

Examples: RAG1 protein core. In immune system, it recombines the loci of immunoglobulins. Signal sequences are derived by the *Transib* transposon.

Also an important protein of the human placenta (Syncytin protein) is derived from the ENV domain of this endogenous retrovirus, and is essential for normal development. 

They can also cause disease: Hemophilia A is a transposon in the wrong place. 

Alu (SINE), SVA (SINE) and L1(LINE) are the youngest elements. 

## L1 Element

6-7 Kb. 

5'UTR - ORF1 - ORF2 - 3' UTR - (A)n

ORF1 = open reading frame, with chaperone activity
ORF2 = 2 domains: endonuclease + reverse transcriptase

500K copies of truncated L1 elements ((...)-(A)n)),  7K copies of FULL L1 elements, 100 of which potentially active. The others have mutations, so the ORF are broken with many stop codons. They are the only active. They generate inter and intraindividual diversity through structural variations.  They create more than 100 diseases, and genomic mosaicism in the brain, maybe neurodegenerative disorders. LINE makes up the 17% of human genome. During retrotranscriptase, another random RNA could be taken and retrotranscribed. 

Of course only mutations in the germinal cell line can be passed to new generations. For long years we tought that they were active only in the gonads (germline TE insertions, carried by half of the gametes), while now we know that there are also somatic TE insertions, in patches of tissues derived from a cell. This was discovered after brain tissue sequencing. TE are active in a normal brain. the max activity is in the hippocampus and cognitive capabilities (memory). There is a conflict, where stress activates those elements, and neurons are stressed because of electrical activity, with ~0.002-13 elements of retrotransposition per neuron. The genome tries to keep them inactivated, sometimes they escape the inactivation.  L1 elements could be involved in neurodegenerative disease (Gustincich), and is significantly lower in Alzheimer patients, decreasing over late stages.

Polymorphic elements: elements that have already been observed in other population, but not in the reference genome.

## nomenclature and classification of insertions

AIS: fixed and known, closer to open chromatin
NIS: novel, mostly somatic, usually closer to open chromatin.
Polymorphic: present in a fraction of human population. Recent on an evolutional scale. like SNPs, are of recent integation and not completely fixed in the human specie. Even more distant than random one from open chromatin. The genome is trying to silence them.
Random insertions are further from open chromatin.

AIS are shared and common. NIS are private and individual.  Polymorphic were analyzed, as markers. 

## Activity of transposons in other intelligent organisms?

21% in humans (100 full length elements)
19% in mice (3000 full length elements)
5% in insects (?)

In Octopus the higher brain function correlates with an higher number of LINE fragments.

Kimura-2 distance (cercare): gives the age of an element, as a distance from the consensus element.

# Central dogma on molecular biology

DNA replicates into new DNA that transcripts to RNA that tranlates into a Protein. Some of those aspects are not exactly always true and accurate. There is non coding RNA. There could be many different isoforms of RNA for the same gene. 

## The Cell

< what are cell, what are its components and organelles, what is the genome and DNA >

## The Genome

Contains all the information of the organism, in each of the $37*10^{12}$ cells of the body. The double helix shape is important for conservation of information because it allows us to make a copy.

3.2 billion nucleotides. 

## DNA

4 bases, forward is from 5' to 3'. Clockwise.  Big issue: start to count from 0 or from 1??? Changes between browser. 20K proteins in the human genome. 

## transcriptome and proteome

All transcript and all proteins.
